# Corporation Favorita Store Sales Forecasting

Welcome to the Corporation Favorita Store Sales Forecasting project! This repository is dedicated to predicting store sales for Corporation Favorita, a prominent grocery retailer in Ecuador. Through advanced time series forecasting and analytics, we aim to develop a robust model that accurately predicts unit sales across various items in different Favorita stores.

# Introduction
This project dives into the intriguing challenge of predicting store sales by leveraging time series forecasting techniques. We explore a diverse dataset containing information about dates, store details, product information, promotional activities, sales figures, and additional enriching data. The ultimate goal is to provide Corporation Favorita with data-driven insights for optimizing inventory management, promotional strategies, and overall business performance.

# Project Description
Title: Enhancing Store Sales Forecasting for Corporation Favorita
Objective:
Develop a robust time series forecasting model to predict store sales for Corporation Favorita, providing accurate predictions for unit sales across a diverse range of items in different Favorita stores.

# Scope:
The project encompasses the exploration and analysis of a comprehensive dataset, including dates, store details, product information, promotional activities, and sales figures. Supplementary files containing additional information will be utilized to enhance the predictive capabilities of the models.

# Data Overview
The project utilizes several datasets, including:

## train.csv:
Training data with features such as store number, product family, onpromotion, and sales.
## test.csv:
Test data for predicting target sales for the 15 days after the last date in the training data.
## transaction.csv:
Information about transactions made on specific dates.
## sample_submission.csv:
A sample submission file in the correct format.
## stores.csv: 
Store metadata, including city, state, type, and cluster.
## oil.csv: 
Daily oil prices, given Ecuador's dependency on oil.
## holidays_events.csv: 
Holidays and Events metadata, including information about transferred holidays.

# Hypothesis and Analytical Questions
## Hypothesis

Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in sales between promoted and non-promoted items.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Items that are promoted have significantly higher sales compared to non-promoted items.

# Analytical Questions

1. Do items on promotion sell more, and is this difference statistically significant?
2. Are sales different between different types of stores?
3. Does the daily oil price correlate with overall sales?
4. Do sales change significantly during holidays?
5. Do some products consistently sell more during certain seasons?
6. Do sales patterns vary depending on the day of the week?

# Model Development
I will select appropriate time series forecasting models. Train the models using the prepared data and incorporate external factors if available. Optimize the models by tuning hyperparameters and selecting the best-performing model.

# Model Evaluation
I will evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics such as MAE, RMSE, MSE, or MAPE. Interpret the models to understand the factors driving store sales and their relative importance.

# Project Deliverables
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report. Data preprocessing and feature engineering documentation. Trained time series forecasting models. Model evaluation and performance analysis. Final project report summarizing the findings, insights, and recommendations.

# Conclusion
The Regression Project (Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting) aims to predict store sales accurately using time series forecasting techniques. By leveraging the provided datasets and following the outlined methodology, I aim to provide valuable insights to Corporation Favorita and develop a reliable forecasting model for store sales. The project will enable informed decision-making, optimize inventory management, and improve overall sales performance for the company.

The ultimate objective is to build a model that accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items.
