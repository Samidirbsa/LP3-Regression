# Introduction
This project dives into the intriguing challenge of predicting store sales by leveraging time series forecasting techniques. We explore a diverse dataset containing information about dates, store details, product information, promotional activities, sales figures, and additional enriching data. The ultimate goal is to provide Corporation Favorita with data-driven insights for optimizing inventory management, promotional strategies, and overall business performance.

# Project Description
Title: Enhancing Store Sales Forecasting for Corporation Favorita
Objective:
Develop a robust time series forecasting model to predict store sales for Corporation Favorita, providing accurate predictions for unit sales across a diverse range of items in different Favorita stores.

# Scope:
The project encompasses the exploration and analysis of a comprehensive dataset, including dates, store details, product information, promotional activities, and sales figures. Supplementary files containing additional information will be utilized to enhance the predictive capabilities of the models.

# Data Overview
The project utilizes several datasets, including:

## train.csv:
Training data with features such as store number, product family, onpromotion, and sales.
## test.csv:
Test data for predicting target sales for the 15 days after the last date in the training data.
## transaction.csv:
Information about transactions made on specific dates.
## sample_submission.csv:
A sample submission file in the correct format.
## stores.csv: 
Store metadata, including city, state, type, and cluster.
## oil.csv: 
Daily oil prices, given Ecuador's dependency on oil.
## holidays_events.csv: 
Holidays and Events metadata, including information about transferred holidays.

# Hypothesis and Analytical Questions
## Hypothesis

Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in sales between promoted and non-promoted items.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Items that are promoted have significantly higher sales compared to non-promoted items.

# Analytical Questions

1. Do items on promotion sell more, and is this difference statistically significant?
2. Are sales different between different types of stores?
3. Does the daily oil price correlate with overall sales?
4. Do sales change significantly during holidays?
5. Do some products consistently sell more during certain seasons?
6. Do sales patterns vary depending on the day of the week?

# Getting Started

Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/favorita-store-sales-forecasting.git

Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Explore the datasets, code, and notebooks to understand the project structure and progress.
Code Overview
The code is organized into sections, covering tasks such as importing libraries, loading data from a SQL database, exploratory data analysis, and merging datasets. The code is well-documented to facilitate understanding and further exploration.

python
Copy code
# Example code snippet
import pyodbc
from dotenv import dotenv_values
import pandas as pd
import warnings

# Importing visualization modules
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.express as px 

# Load environment variables from .env file into a dictionary
environment_variables = dotenv_values('.env')

# ...

# Establish a connection to the database using the provided connection string.
connection= pyodbc.connect(connection_string)

# ...

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
# Display column information, summary statistics, and check for missing values
# Transform the 'date' column to datetime format
# Handle missing values in the 'dcoilwtico' column

# ...

# 4. Merging The Train Dataset with the Stores, Transactions, Holiday Events, and Oil Dataset
# Merge datasets based on common columns ('store_nbr' and 'date')
